Turning raw eDNA data into useful biodiversity insights 


Zarq is like a super-smart tool for biodiversity. It takes messy DNA data from the environment, cleans it up, and then hunts for patterns using clever math like counting DNA chunks and measuring randomness.
Once it spots something meaningful, Zarq uses AI models like deep learning and LightGBM to figure out which species the DNA might belong to. It then calculates biodiversity metrics and displays everything on interactive dashboards so humans can easily understand the ecosystem.
